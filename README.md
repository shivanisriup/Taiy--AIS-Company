# Taiy--AIS-Company
Description: AIS vessel tracking has been the mariner’s most significant development in navigation safety since the introduction of radar. AIS tracking system was originally developed as a collision avoidance tool that enables commercial vessels to ‘see’ each other more clearly in any conditions and to improve the helmsman’s information about the surrounding environment. AIS does this by continuously transmitting vessels’ position, identity, speed, and course, along with other relevant information, to all other AIS-equipped vessels within range. Combined with a shore station, this system also offers port authorities and maritime safety bodies the ability to manage maritime traffic and reduce the hazards of marine navigation.   The task is to scrape the station coverage data from the following link: https://www.aishub.net/stations and also store it in a time series format   https://www.aishub.net/
